# JWatch - A Quartz Monitor #

JWatch provides real-time monitoring for the Java Quartz Scheduler library, in one easy-to-use, browser-based, open source, and free, user-interface.

_Note: At present, JWatch can only interact with Quartz 2.0+. Future releases will support older versions of Quartz._

## JWatch Benefits ##

  * Monitor multiple Quartz Instances across multiple applications concurrently.
  * Monitor multiple Schedulers and Jobs per Quartz Instance.
  * Drill-down for more information in to Quartz Job and Trigger objects.
  * Real-Time monitoring of presently executing jobs.
  * [RESTful JSON API](RESTfulAPI.md) for those wishing to extend the application.
  * Easy to deploy - just drop in a war and configure your instances.
  * **It's free!** ([LGPL](http://code.google.com/p/jwatch/source/browse/trunk/LICENSE))
